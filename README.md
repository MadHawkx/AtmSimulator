-In order to run the project you will need to download an SQL database.

-I recommend using [Wamp server.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/files/latest/download)

-Make a database and create 2 tables "login" and "account". Do check the [conn.java](https://github.com/MadHawkx/AtmSimulator/blob/master/src/ASimulatorSystem/conn.java) file in order to make sure your database name is 

-After that please look into how you'll configure the database with your IDE.

-Using login.java as the main class file run the project.
